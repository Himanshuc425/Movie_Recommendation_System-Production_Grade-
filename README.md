## Phase 1: Advanced Algorithm Architecture

### Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF)

The `neural_collaborative_filtering.py` module implements a hybrid NCF model that combines:

- **Generalized Matrix Factorization (GMF)**: A neural network generalization of matrix factorization
- **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**: Deep neural networks for learning complex user-item interactions
- **NeuMF**: A fusion model that combines GMF and MLP for better performance

Key features:
- User and item embedding layers
- Customizable neural network architecture
- Support for implicit and explicit feedback
- Efficient mini-batch training

### Graph Neural Networks (GNN)

The `graph_neural_network.py` module implements a GNN-based recommendation system that models user-item interactions as a bipartite graph:

- **Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)**: Learns node embeddings by aggregating information from neighbors
- **Message Passing**: Propagates user and item features through the graph structure
- **Graph Attention**: Weights the importance of different connections

Key features:
- Captures higher-order connectivity patterns
- Leverages the graph structure of user-item interactions
- Handles cold-start problems more effectively
- Provides more diverse recommendations

### Enhanced Feature Engineering

The `enhanced_features.py` module implements advanced feature engineering techniques:

- **Temporal Features**: Time-based patterns in user behavior
  - Hour/day/month cyclical encoding
  - Recency and frequency features
  - Seasonal patterns

- **Contextual Features**: User and item context
  - User behavior patterns
  - Item popularity dynamics
  - Session-based features
  - Geographic and demographic context

- **Interaction Features**: User-item interaction patterns
  - Sequential patterns
  - Cross-feature interactions
  - User-item affinity scores

## Usage

To run the advanced recommendation system demo:

```python
python advanced_recommender_demo.py
```

This will:
1. Load or generate sample movie data
2. Apply enhanced feature engineering
3. Train and evaluate the NCF model
4. Train and evaluate the GNN model
5. Compare the performance of different models

## Performance Improvements

Compared to traditional recommendation approaches, the advanced algorithms provide:

- **Higher accuracy**: Lower RMSE and MAE on rating prediction
- **Better personalization**: More relevant recommendations for individual users
- **Improved cold-start handling**: Better recommendations for new users and items
- **Greater diversity**: Less popularity bias in recommendations

## Phase 2: Production-Grade Architecture

The system has been enhanced with a production-grade architecture using microservices, containerization, and MLOps pipelines:

### Microservices Architecture

The system is divided into three main microservices:

1. **Data Pipeline Service**
   - Processes raw data from various sources
   - Handles data cleaning, transformation, and feature extraction
   - Publishes processed data to Kafka for downstream consumption
   - Implements monitoring with Prometheus metrics

2. **Model Training Service**
   - Consumes processed data from Kafka
   - Trains NCF and GNN models with enhanced features
   - Tracks experiments and model versions with MLflow
   - Publishes trained models for the inference service

3. **Inference Service**
   - Provides real-time recommendation API endpoints
   - Loads trained models for inference
   - Implements caching with Redis for high-performance responses
   - Supports A/B testing between different model versions

### Containerization and Orchestration

The system uses Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration:

- **Docker**: Each microservice is containerized with its dependencies
- **Kubernetes**: Manages deployment, scaling, and operations
  - Horizontal Pod Autoscaling for the inference service
  - Persistent volumes for model storage and databases
  - Service discovery and load balancing

### MLOps Pipeline

The MLOps pipeline automates the development, deployment, and monitoring lifecycle:

- **Continuous Integration/Deployment**: GitHub Actions workflow for testing, building, and deploying
- **Model Versioning**: MLflow for tracking experiments and model versions
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana for system and model performance monitoring
- **Messaging**: Kafka for reliable data streaming between services

## Deployment

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Kubernetes cluster (for production deployment)
- GitHub account (for CI/CD pipeline)

### Local Development

To run the system locally with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Production Deployment

To deploy to a Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
# Apply Kubernetes configurations
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/
```

## Phase 3: Advanced Features & Innovation

- **Image Processing**: Uses ResNet50 to extract visual features from movie posters and promotional images
- **Text Processing**: Processes movie descriptions, reviews, and metadata using CNNs
- **Fusion Techniques**: Combines collaborative filtering with visual and textual features

Key benefits:
- More nuanced understanding of content
- Better cold-start recommendations using content features
- Improved recommendation diversity

### Reinforcement Learning

The `reinforcement_learning.py` module implements a reinforcement learning approach to recommendations:
